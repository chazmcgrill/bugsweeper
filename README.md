Recreation of the classic windows desktop game minesweeper. The aim of the game is to choose squares avoiding the
randomly placed bugs. Flags can be placed by right clicking.

The most interesting part was working out how to clear the empty cells. This required building a 'flood fill' algorithm
and applying this to the react logic.
