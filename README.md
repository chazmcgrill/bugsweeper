# Bugsweeper Game
Recreation of the classic windows desktop game minesweeper.
The aim of the game is to choose squares avoiding the randomly 
placed mines. Flags can be placed by right clicking.

The most interesting part was working out how to clear the empty 
cells. This required building a 'flood fill' algorithm and 
applying this to the react logic.

- React
- Typescript
